            <li>5 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons mayonnaise</li>
            <li>1/2 teapoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>3 ounces low-moisture shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>3 ounces Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place 1 stick unsalted butter in a small bowl and let sit at room temperature until softened.</li>
            <li>Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat the oven to 425ºF. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or aluminum foil</li>
            <li>Cut 1 loaf Italian bread in half horizontally with a serrated knife. Halve each piece crosswise for a total of 4 pieces. Place the pieces cut-side up on the baking sheet.
            </li>
            <li>Thinly slice 2 medium scallions. Reserve 1 tablespoon of the dark green parts for garnish, then add the remaining to the bowl of butter. Mince 5 garlic cloves and add to the bowl of butter.
            </li>
            <li>Add 2 tablespoons mayonnaise, 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, 1/2 teaspoon granulated sugar, and 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt to the butter. Smash and stir together until combined into a spreadable paste. Spread the garlic butter evenly onto the cut side of the bread.
            </li>
            <li>Grate 3 ounces low-moisture mozzarella cheese on the large holes of a box grater (about 1 cup). Grate 3 ounces Parmesan cheese on the small holes of a box grater (about 1 cup). Place both cheeses in a medium bowl and toss to combine. Sprinkle the cheeses evenly over the garlic bread.
            </li>
            <li>Bake until the cheese is melted and browned in spots, about 15 minutes. Garnish with the reserved scallions.
