        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This is an amazing recipe passed down from generations of Italian-American immigrants in my family. I've tweaked to be even more decadent that the original recipe! I hope you enjoy it!
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1lb ground beef</li>
            <li>1lb ground pork</li>
            <li>1 medium sized onion</li>
            <li>1 rib of celery</li>
            <li>1 medium sized onion</li>   
            <li>2 carrots </li>
            <li>2 cloves of garlic thinly sliced </li>
            <li>3 Tbsp tomato paste</li>
            <li> 1 cup white wine</li>
            <li>1.5 cups chicken stock</li>
            <li>1 can of crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
            <li>16oz of whole milk ricotta</li>
            <li>Lasagna pasta sheets</li>
            <li>Fresh mozzarella</li>
            <li>13 slices of prosciutto di parma</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>To make the sauce, take 1lb of ground beef and 1lb of ground pork and mix together in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Then in a large heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat, add in enough oil to coat the bottom. Take about half of your meat mixture and pat it into a large thin patty. Sear your meat in the pot for about 2-3 minutes on both sides. Repeat that until you use all of your meat. Remove meat from the pan and set it off to the side.</li>
            <li>n that same pan, cook off 4 ounces of guanciale or pancetta over medium heat until it releases its fat and fried itself in it. Once that’s done frying, add to that pot 1 medium onion finely diced, 1 finely diced celery, and 2 finely diced carrots. Give it a stir and let it saute over medium heat for about 2 minutes or until all the vegetables turn translucent.</li>
            <li>Then add in 3 tablespoons of tomato paste. Stir and let it cook in the pot until it begins to stick to the bottom. Add in 1 cup of white wine or water and give it a stir. Let the mixture simmer until it’s reduced by about half. Then add in 1 ½ cups of chicken stock, 17.6 ounces of crushed tomatoes, and your cooked meat. Allow that to simmer for about 1-2 hours or until it’s reduced and mostly meaty.</li>
            <li>To assemble your lasagna, first grease a 9x13 inch baking pan with butter. Apply a very thin layer of sauce in the bottom to prevent sticking. Then layer your lasagna by placing a layer of pasta sheets, ½ cup of whole milk ricotta, fresh basil leaves, prosciutto di parma, your meat sauce and then a layer of parmigiano-reggiano, fontina and mozzarella. Repeat this layering process until the pan is full.</li>
            <li>Top your lasagna with cheese and place on a baking sheet. Put your lasagna in the oven preheated to 350 degrees Fahrenheit and cook for one hour or until nice and brown. Remove from the oven and let it rest for 20-25 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
